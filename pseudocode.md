1. Create the Game Board

    Statement: Define a function to create and initialize the game board. Use an IIFE to encapsulate the board's state and methods.

2. Define Player Factory Function

    Statement: Create a factory function to generate player objects. Each player object should have a name and a symbol (X or O). This function should encapsulate player-specific logic.

3. Manage Game State

    Statement: Use an IIFE to manage the game state, including tracking the current player, the board state, and checking for a win or draw condition. Ensure that the state is not exposed globally.

4. Handle User Interactions

    Statement: Define functions to handle user interactions, such as clicking on a cell. These functions should update the game state and board UI, but they should not rely on global variables.

5. Implement Game Logic

    Statement: Encapsulate the game logic, such as checking for a winner or a draw, within functions or IIFEs. Ensure that these functions operate on the game state defined within the IIFE.

6. Update the UI

    Statement: Create functions to update the game board UI based on the current game state. These functions should work with the state managed by the IIFE or factory functions.

7. Start a New Game

    Statement: Implement a function to reset the game state and UI for a new game. Use an IIFE or factory function to encapsulate the reset logic.

8. Avoid Global Variables

    Statement: Minimize the use of global variables by keeping state and functions encapsulated within IIFEs and factory functions. Use closures to access and modify state as needed.
